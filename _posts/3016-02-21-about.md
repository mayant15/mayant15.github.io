<hr />

I was introduced to Jekyll at a [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/)
meetup and was eager to use it on the ol' web site, which was definitely in
need of a responsive overhaul. On the [Jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org)
site, the [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) designs caught my eye the most.
Even so, none of the Jekyll themes had a menu header that stayed in place while
scrolling, so I browsed HTML5 UP directly and came across the
[Spectral theme](https://html5up.net/spectral).
It was perfect, and so began the Jekyll hack of Spectral to create the site
and repo.

HTML5 UP's Spectral is primarily a landing page design with support for a
few pages linked off from the menu. When I posted the first
[_Jekyll port_ of Spectral](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/spectral/),
I didn't add much Jekyll coding for it to be suitable for a blog and
portfolio. After forking my personal site from that original, the intention was
to merge some features back to the original, but it has expanded so much that
a _merge_ will never happen, particularly because there are many who do just
want to use Spectral as a landing page---change a few config variables and be
on their way. But, that original port of Spectral is surely in need of a 
little love and should someday at least provide the first two features listed
on the next page. ‚ù§
