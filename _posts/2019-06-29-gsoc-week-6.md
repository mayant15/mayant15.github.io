title: "Week 6: Connecting Cities with Rails"
description: "Creating Terasology Railways!"
---

This week I had to improve roads created last week and lay down rail tracks on them.

# Performance Issues

Last week's roads severely impacted performance. To get to the bottom of this, I used [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/) to check which methods were taking the most time. It was _Lakes_. Unfortunately facet configuration for Lakes doesn't work right now so I cannot disable Lakes. I had to completely remove it from the module.

Another improvement is not connecting every city with every other city. So if we have cities A and B when city C is created, a rail will be laid down from C to either A or B depending on which is closer and not both.

# Rails

The construction system uses a `RoadRasterizer` to lay down actual blocks for the road. All I needed to do was create a custom `RailRasterizer` in MetalRenegades which inherits from the default `RoadRasterizer` in DynamicCities. I also needed a `RoadManager` in MetalRenegades to pass this custom rasterizer to the construction system.

For the actual placement of rails within the road segment, I decided to keep it simple. Rails are only placed on two sides, along the border of the segment. I originally thought of filling segments with gravel and then placing rails on top, but that would again severely impact performance so it is left for later. What I still need to fix are some minor issues at segment borders where rails cannot connect properly.
