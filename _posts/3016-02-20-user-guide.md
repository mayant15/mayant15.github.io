This guide is provided to help you author posts. For set up and usage guidance,
see the [Github README](https://github.com/arkadianriver/arkadianriver.com).

{% include post_note.html text="These pages are located in the _posts folder of the repo. Because the posts are dated in the future they are not part of a standard production build, except on Github pages. For Github pages, keep future set to false in your _config.yml file, move these 31st century pages to the _drafts folder, or delete these pages and just refer to them online, linked-to from the Github README." %}
