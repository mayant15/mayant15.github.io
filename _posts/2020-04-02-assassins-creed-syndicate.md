***Note: This article has spoilers.***

Let me start this by saying I haven't played an Assassin's Creed game in a very long time. The last story I completed was Revelations, and after that, I've tried III, Black Flag and Unity to some degree. I am not aware of what's happening in the "modern timeline" and will talk about this game as a standalone thing. As of this writing, I have completed the main story, but I haven't played the various character side missions or all WW1 stories. Let's get into it then.

## Setting

We have two playable characters this time. Siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. The game starts with a little tutorial to help you get to know both of them. They have totally different personalities and different fighting styles with Jacob being the reckless talks-with-his-fists type and Evie being the stealthy type. The game doesn't stop you from playing the way you want with either character, but there are some skills that only one of them can learn. Both of them have access to all equipment.

Most of the action happens in London, a large dull city with an even larger income gap. Sometimes it is colourful, sometimes it is bleak, but mostly it is pretty empty. This is just a personal preference, but I like worlds filled with details that make your experience more immersive, like Kamurocho (Yakuza series) or Prague (Deus Ex Mankind Divided). I really don't know if historical accuracy is what they were going for, and that is why the city is the way it is. It is simply not that interesting to look at for me. Again, this is just a matter of personal taste. I don't really play open-world games a lot.

Gang rivalries and gaining control of boroughs is a nice addition, but like other optional things to do in this game, it gets stale pretty fast. It basically boils down to doing 3-4 categories of activities at least twice, i.e. doing 8-9 of these activities, and then fighting a gang leader to get control of a borough. Rinse and repeat for every district. The activities stay the same, the gang leader battles remain the same. There is a "friendship meter" and doing these activities repeatedly will get you more rewards from those friends. These rewards could be upgrades or new weapons. But it really doesn't matter which borough you do them in. The fact that you're doing these activities to take control of an area doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is doing these activities. WW1 memories brought some very welcome change of pace to the game, but it is mostly plagued by the same problems. There's loads of stuff to collect, which gives you pages and pages of material to read in the in-game encyclopedia that I almost always skipped.

## Gameplay

The moment to moment gameplay is where this game shines. All missions have a lot more options and allow more freedom in their approach than what I remember from previous games in the series. It's the same dumb AI, but stealth still feels tenser, timing is crucial and provides more options for more tactical approaches to most situations. Every encounter allows you to silently pick enemies off one by one or just go in guns blazing. I mostly used the first method - go to a rooftop, scan and mark all enemies with eagle sense, pick them off one by one and approach the objective. Things might not always go smoothly though, and when shit hits the fan, you fight your way through it. Assassinations feel very satisfying, basic counters and tool combos are very fluid and just taking on an entire group is overall a solid experience. Things might be simple, but they're still fun. And it is this core gameplay that somehow redeems the game from its overly stale activities and story.

Kidnapping is a fine addition too. I was pretty sceptical about this (probably because I messed up the tutorial and couldn't see its full potential), but later in the game, once you get better at it with bounties and missions, it becomes an invaluable tool for stealth. The only thing that I don't like about the combat here is that boss battles are often interrupted with quick-time events that are just bad. It's a very wonky camera angle and bad animations make it look more like you're watching Loony Toons. It's just hard to take the game seriously when it does this.

There are quite a few progression systems at work here. There are player and weapon stats, gear, new skills that you can learn with XP points, character exclusive ultimate skills and upgrades for your gang that affect the city at large. These upgrades really do make a difference, and it is pretty satisfying to see that your time spent playing this game paid off.

Assassination missions are where this game peaked for me. Holy shit when you first get the option to unlock a "unique kill". Usually, there are three people of interest for each of these assassination stages. Talking to them helps you to infiltrate the area or to find an alternate way of killing your target, like disguising as someone they trust and then stabbing them in the neck with your blade. And sometimes you discover them on your own and sometimes someone briefs you, which took me back to the times when Pedro used to give me ideas on the boat in the original Dishonored :')

## Story

Look, I can totally forgive the bland chores if you give me a good story. Did you give me a good story? No. It was as dull as the game's activities. The characters are always seen at a surface level and you never really get to know them. They don't develop at all throughout the story. It feels like what you're experiencing is just another portion of their long, adventurous lives. It is not a tale of a glorious adventure that would completely change their and our lives. There are characters like George Westhouse, seems like a pretty important person but only appears in the opening five minutes of the game. I decided to look up his fandom page while writing this article. It was only then that I realized this game's story actually falls between Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India and the novel Assassin's Creed Underworld. Not having this context on the story might be why I could not experience the story fully. These snippets of lore might have been in the pages that I skipped, but mainline games should be self-contained, or at least only depend on their predecessors. 

Then there's Henry, a bland character whose only purpose is to serve as Evie's romantic interest. Now if you're going to make this a romance, make it a romance. If you're going to make it an action game, make it an action game. But please don't try to do both at once and mess both up. There are plenty of examples of action stories that masterfully handle romance to complement the story, but this just isn't one of them. I'm not emotionally invested in these characters at all, and the romance angle doesn't even play a part in the main story. It puts a strain on Jacob and Evie's relationship, but does that affect the gameplay at all? No. Does that make any difference? No. Does that have any effect on the ending? Nope.

The villains might be slightly better but are still forgettable. Maxwell Roth is the most entertaining character in the entire game, and we get to see him for one sequence only. It's a shame. Crawford Starrick is always seen in his office sulking and does absolutely nothing for the entire game. He's the one that's supposedly ruling London from the shadows but doesn't lift a finger when all of his allies die one by one. The final battle with Starrick does nothing to make me feel any different. It is absolutely not the highlight of this story. It feels like just another gang leader battle, even with the abilities of a Piece of Eden involved. It might not be an "end" to the adventures of the Frye twins, but it is definitely the end of this game that I'm playing, so it should feel like it. It just doesn't.

## Summary

Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a game with a good gameplay loop, which is honestly really fun. It retains the core gameplay elements that make this series so great and also adds some new changes like kidnapping and the assassination options. But the repetitive side activities suck out all that fun. Bored with them and want to focus on the main story only? You can't because the main story is just as uninteresting.
