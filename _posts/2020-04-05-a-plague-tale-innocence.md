A Plague Tale Innocence is a linear single-player story, and the story is what it focuses on entirely. This game was good. Very good. It wasn't perfect though, so let's try and break it down a bit.

## Story

The game is set in 14th century France in the middle of a recent plague outbreak, which I assumed was the Black Death. You play as a young girl Amicia whose life is totally changed due to the events in the prologue. She must protect her younger brother, Hugo, who suffers from a "sickness" that is not the plague. The game follows their journey as they investigate why the Inquisition is after Hugo and try to survive on the run.

For most of the game, you will have Hugo holding on to you. You have the option to make him wait and move alone, which allows you to move faster, but there's a catch. Leave Hugo alone for more than a minute, and he'll start to panic. He will start calling for you, and that would alert your enemies. Hugo might seem like a liability, but the writers have done a fantastic job of making you actually care about Hugo. Every time Amicia goes up a ladder or jumps over a fence, she helps Hugo up too. Hugo is vulnerable and is suddenly pushed into a situation that is way beyond what he can understand. And he acts exactly like that. Sometimes he'll be brave and stay by your side to help you, but sometimes it is just too much for him to handle and he'll panic or throw a tantrum with no regard for how dangerous the place is. It is in these raw moments of emotion that you see the cast develop.

Every member in the cast has a defining moment which shapes them for the story to come. Killing someone for the first time was traumatic for Amicia, and the game took a step back to acknowledge that. But as the story progresses, she kills more easily, coping by saying something like "there's no other choice, it had to be done". Killing is the only way to survive, and our lead characters slowly adapt to it. Kind of like in the Tomb Raider reboot (2013) Lara's first kill was a huge part of the game, but she gradually became a ruthless killing machine. Although Plague did not go for that level of intensity, transitions like these take these games to an entirely different level.

## Art and Sound

The writing is impressive, but the sound and the environments carry that story here. Voice performances seemed average for the first part of the game, but in the last 4-5 chapters, they totally nailed it. You could close your eyes and still feel the emotions that they wanted to convey. The soundtrack perfectly reflects the atmosphere of dread and helplessness that you're thrown into. I imagine thousands of rats right in front of you in real life would be really loud. Instead, that was toned down to let some of the soundtrack in. That helped elevate the tension even further. 

On the visual side of things, this game is an absolute looker. You start the game in a forest and immediately realize that the attention to detail in your surroundings is insane. The game runs smoothly despite the number of objects it has to draw every frame. All the foliage and rats should have had an enormous performance hit, but it is clear that a lot of work has been put in to make it not be that way. This is a world that looks believable and lived in. Something horrible has happened in these lands, and you can feel it.

Every location in the game is very different to look at even when it is majorly set in forests and ruins. That is an achievement. Even places that you revisit will be very different the second time and reflect your state in the game. In just the prologue, you'll go from a bright, colourful forest to a dark, dead swamp-like area. The transition between these locations reflects what your character is feeling and warns you about what's to come. Death is in the air.

The game is not able to keep this realism and immersion going though. Facial animations here are really not the greatest. When you're going for a deep raw story, not expressing those emotions on your face can really take away from the overall experience. The voice actor might be yelling and crying, but the in-game model has the same look, like always, with only their lips moving. Surprisingly, the final villain is *much* better animated than Amicia. I found little glitches here and there too. Jittery movements near walls, control not returning after a cutscene and sound sources abruptly turning on or off depending on my camera angle. Still, these were few and far between.

## Gameplay

Now, this is a stealth game. It is the "throw-rocks-to-distract-guards" mechanic turned into a game. And it still manages to feel fresh for the entire duration. You absolutely cannot be spotted because guards can instantly kill you. Every stage is a mini-puzzle where you use the environment, your items and your slingshot to find the best way to pass unnoticed. 

Amicia must craft these items using materials she finds in the world. While the resources are plentiful here, they're not enough to use with both upgrades and items. You must balance them. For example, there is an item called somnum which you can craft. But somnum needs fabric and fabric is rare. Fabric is also vital for upgrades, which were a priority for me. So I tried to complete the game without using somnum. You will always have enough resources to craft whatever you need and whenever you need, but crafting them will affect your chances of getting your upgrades. 

You could approach all stages in multiple ways, but the game is still linear. Your goal, and a simple path to get to that goal, are immediately apparent.  However, thinking for a minute will get you an alternate route with better rewards, like more resources or even some secrets. You might be tempted to kill a guard to move forward, but there might be ways to distract him instead.

A reason why the game feels fresh the entire time is because it keeps throwing new ideas at you regularly. You'll keep getting new tools and new items or new environmental elements to interact with. Every new character you'll encounter will have a purpose. Some will give you new crafting options and some will have useful skills. The game never lets you get bored. While the sound and environments maintain a certain basic level of tension, the game throws new toys at you to experiment with. 

A Plague Tale is a good game throughout, but the final chapters are where it goes on to become one of the best games I have played in a while. I will have to be careful here to avoid spoilers, though. The final few boss battles totally caught me off guard. It still remains that linear puzzle game in spirit, but now with a dash of grand chaos. Like all previous stages, it is clear what you have to do to defeat the boss, but quick thinking and timing are a lot more critical now. Add to that the genuine risk of instant death at any minor slip up. These battles are cinematic, thrilling and challenging, but not frustrating. These are not one-on-one duels, because Amicia cannot fight an adult man head-on. These are not sneaking and distracting to slip past either. This is using your instincts to survive a situation that you've been put it, and you can clearly see the danger. These boss battles make the game's ending so satisfying.

## Summary

A Plague Tale is a single-player linear story-driven stealth game with a stellar cast of characters and a deep, raw narrative. The environments and score make it an experience hard to forget. The gameplay is tense and keeps throwing enough new elements at you to keep it from getting stale. The final few chapters deliver a cinematic and satisfying end to the experience. That said, the game could definitely use a bit more polish with facial animations and voice acting early in the game. I kept coming across minor bugs which were not game-breaking, but they definitely took away from the entire experience. Finally, this is not a puzzle game. The game doesn't force you to think out of the box, but the puzzle-like stages are just there to help the narrative. They're fun to play through but only require a few seconds to figure out what you need to do. Overall, it is definitely one of the best games I've played recently and is something you should definitely experience.
