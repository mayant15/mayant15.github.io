I'm Mayant, a senior mathematics undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I'm interested in software architecture, designing complex programmes with multiple independent components that run in harmony. My current field of interest is computer graphics and I'm working on a game engine called [Lotus](https://github.com/mayant15/lotus/). Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayant-mukul-222086172/) or by [email](mailto:mayantmukul@gmail.com).
