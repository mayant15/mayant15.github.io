## 2017

I move out of my apartment in San Francisco and don't sign a new lease. I start working remotely for Airbnb, spending ⅔ of my time on the road living with friends, family, and strangers.

## 2015

In July, Cait and I break up; I am crushed. I throw myself into work as never before and spend the next 12 months working 14-hour days and building what will become Airbnb Experiences. My teammates become family, the closest friendships I've made since moving west.

## 2014

Cait and I live together for six months at Grammy's House Co-op. I land my dream job as a software engineer at Airbnb.

## 2012

I settle into my job at Findery. I meet Kathy, we date for three months. I write a lot of letters back and forth with Cait. She moves to San Francisco, and we're dating before she's finished unpacking.

## 2011

During a one week vacation in San Francisco, I attend two job interviews for fun. I leave the city with two offers and a tangle of thoughts. Two weeks later I leave my job at MyWebGrocer and move to San Francisco with one suitcase and two boxes. I meet [Jim](http://jimwhimpey.com/)—whom I will later steal the idea for this page from—on Craigslist, and we move into an apartment together. It has no living room and a kooky old landlord named Bill.

## 2010

I graduate from Champlain College with a Bachelors of Science in Electronic Game and Interactive Development, Art & Animation. I stay in Burlington, and land my first post-collegiate job as a web developer for Red Barn Media Group. I move in with Craig and Lindsey. I participate in my first hackathon and am subsequently offered a job at MyWebGrocer, which I accept.

## 2009

I take a semester abroad in Montreal, making a game with my closest friends. I become vegan.

## 2008

School intensifies; I become intimately familiar with the term "all-nighter". I lose 30 pounds over the summer, running a mile every night. I realize I've subconsciously stopped eating meat; I become vegetarian.

## 2007

Back in Connecticut for the summer, I'm hired full time by Jim, head of a local product marketing company in need of a web developer. I tell him I can rebuild his website and spend the first month on the job actually learning how to.

## 2006

I'm accepted, early admission, to Champlain College. I graduate from high school. Kristen teaches me the soul-crushing pain of infidelity; we break up. I move to Burlington, Vermont to study 3D art and animation.

## 2005

Our film crew goes by _Question Productions_ and begins to submit films to local festivals. We win some awards. I meet Kristen; we start dating.

## 2004

I pirate a copy of Dreamweaver and start teaching myself to make websites.

## 2003

I start spending time with Sean. We start the VPC, the Video Production Club, a group from which I will derive lifelong friendships, my first passions, and reprieve from the monotony of high school.

## 2002

I start high school. I am quiet and shy; I am a nerd with rudimentary social skills.

## 2001

I play Starcraft for many, many hours. Middle school is terrible; everything is awkward.

## 2000

I finish elementary school. I muster the courage to ask Jen to the 6th grade dance. Vitamin C's "Graduation (Friends Forever)" plays at our graduation ceremony; my peers sob. We will not be friends forever; we are naive. Jen breaks up with me the first week of middle school.

## 1988

Hello, world. I am born, Michael Richard Fowler, in Hartford, Connecticut. Coming in heavy at 8lbs 8oz.
