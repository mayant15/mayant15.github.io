title: "Week 7: AdvancedRails and Combat"
description: "Small adjustments to locomotive carts and quivers."
---

This week saw a lot of smaller additions across many different modules. A short summary of each is given below.

# Rails

A new AdvancedRails module was created to store all relevant features from AdditionalRails, fixed. This week I extracted the locomotive cart. It was missing a `NetworkComponent`, adding which solved two issues. Work on joining it with minecarts is still required.

# Combat

Basic additions were made to the combat system this week. Issue [#33](https://github.com/Terasology/CombatSystem/issues/33) was solved which fixed networking of the quiver UI. Basic pistol and gatling gun prefabs were added and these weapons can now be used in the module.
