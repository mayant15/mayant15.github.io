title: "Week 13: Player Item Drops"
description: "You lose everything once you die."
---

This week was a struggle through multiple network issues I encountered while implementing a very innocent-looking feature - item drops on player death.

# WalletSystem NPEs

The last post described the issue in detail. This week I fixed it which not only removed the NPE but also improved the Wallet UI for clients.

# Player Drops

Issue [#33](https://github.com/Terasology/MetalRenegades/issues/33) happened because the `CombatStartingInventory` got entities from authority which it just gave to the player inventory. So all items irrespective of the player were owned by the authority.

This was an issue as `DropItemRequest` first checked for ownership of entities. Fixing that allowed me to implement player drops relatively easily.
